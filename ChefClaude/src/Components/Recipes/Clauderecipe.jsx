            {<Ingredientlist />}

            <strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onion is translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the Bolognese sauce to the cooked pasta and toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
